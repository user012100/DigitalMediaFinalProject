        <h4>Evil Media Written Component</h4>
            
        <p>Evil Media by Matthew Fuller and Andrew Goffey is an attempt to develop understanding of contemporary media systems. It analyzes techniques and practices of mediation in our era of participation. The authors are more interested in the secondary and tertiary consequences of evil media, not only the obvious ones. The authors begin by explaining the concept of evil in media. Evil has an active capacity to shape or manipulate the things or the people in which they come into contact, and knowing how to manipulate these objects and knowing when you are manipulated by them is considered wisdom. To explain how exactly evil media affects us, the authors talk about them through stratagems, which are ways of exploring the opportunities and exploiting media.</p>
        
        <p>The first stratagem that the authors begin with is intelligence, which encompasses brainwashing, systematic ambiguity and leverage anxiety. Brainwashing is mind control, it is the manipulation of the thought process. One of the most famous example of mind control is Charles Manson, who was a cult leader in late 60s. He used manipulation techniques similarly to how the authors envisioned it, using drugs. He would provide people with acid and once he did, the things he would tell them produce a "self-evident" fact that allows people to shift their perspective and change their thoughts easier.</p>
        
        <p>"The evils of media lay in the patterns of the way we put thoughts into each other's heads, making manufactured things seem like human nature, and science is the means by which we justify these truths."</p>
        
        <p>Systematic ambiguity implies that the relationship between humans and machines is almost non-existent. The line between unconcious and concious beings online has faded, and allowed that power relationship of humans talking to machines and machines talking to machines. Frequently used in user design, it allows us to become more attached to technology by making it human-like. Most things in design imitate nature, but by mimmicking human behavior one can create an illusion of closeness. Leverage anxiety is a technique that turns fears into manifested reality, by creating hoaxes. Online, the spread of information never stops, and by creating hoaxes and myths, it creates a subconcious "other" or "enemy".</p>
        
        <p>"Inside the box, the rules are followed, no matter what they are."</p>
        
        <p>Social engineering is part of togetherness, along with other strratagems like economize behavior and mobilizing irritation. Social engineering is the idea that rules, like laws, have bee created to contain order in society. Similar to the Panopticon theory, surveillance is key element in making sure everyone does what's been ordered. While in a Panopticon it was physical surveillance with a center watchtower, in our digital age surveillance implies use of hidden cameras and facial recognition. If rules are not followed, there will be consequences. For my ecology, the ruleset determines that everyone who wants freedom of travel has to pay $2.75 to use the subway. People agree to that because that is how they were programmed to think, norlizing that behavior in society.</p>
        
        <p>Economize behavior explores this concept further, by noting that data is being created without our consent. In the beginning of social media, data was very valuable. Companies like Facebook and Instagram were created to mine data about a person and then sell this data. Social media as a concept is the best way to do that because it provides the person with the illusion of personalization, and the freedom of communication. As more people use social media, the networks become more tangled with unlimited information. This exploitation of data has been going on since the invention of the Internet and it is impossible to have data be collected about us, especially as technology changes. Nowadays, all of our consumer electronics are desiged to record information about us, like Smart TVs, smart watches and even speakers and air purifiers.</p>
        
        <p>Mobilizing irritation goes hand in hand with economizing behavior. Social media creates addiction; clicking, dragging, cutting and pasting become symbols that can all be calculated, and allowing the financialization of everyday life. Social media relies on connection and human contact, therefore it is very easy for companies to put a price tag on small activities that are only limited to a specific code. Algorithms play into this as well, by creating an automated sequence that determines in which way a program will perform instructions. Real-world task get translated into finite algorithmic operations that almost always have a certain human bias to them.</p>
