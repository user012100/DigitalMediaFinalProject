        <h4>Economize Behavior</h4>
   
        <p>Economizing behavior is an economic principle that relies on extracting knowledge that is profitable. It is linked  to the idea of exploitation of knowledge that we discussed earlier. Companies like Facebook, Instagram, or even Snapchat operate based on an exploitation system. Without people sharing their information with the companies, they cannot build extensive networks of people and information, which is what these websites are reliant on. The data that is sold to 3rd-party companies is how profit is generated in the digital economy. It is an economy based on free labor, or as the authors call it, "cyborg science". Gadgets that create a sense of addiction, like any form of social media, serve to implement the financialization of everyday life. Sophisticated technology requires users to be enrolled into an economy of minimal movement, which is perfect when all of our devices are made for easy use and not a lot of movement.</p>
