        <h4>Social Engineering</h4>

        <p>One of the very early examples of social engineering was explained by Jeremy Bentham through the Panopticon theory:</p>
        
        <p>"There is a central tower surrounded by cells. In the central tower is the watchman. In the cells are prisoners – or workers, or children, depending on the use of the building. The tower shines bright light so that the watchman is able to see everyone in the cells. The people in the cells, however, aren’t able to see the watchman, and therefore have to assume that they are always under observation." <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/jul/23/panopticon-digital-surveillance-jeremy-bentham" target="_blank">[1]</a></p>
        
        <p>This idea of the Panopticon ties directly into what social engineering is like, using mechanisms and techniques to control society. In the modern world, there are rules implemented through the concept of law, which creates order and societal control. In the current digital landscape, surveillance has become more commonly increasing. All digital devices that we use are interconnected now through the Internet, making social engineering much easier to implement on a much wider level.</p>
        
        <p>Consumer electronics has a much bigger audience now than it had in 2007. As technology improves, its accessibility increase. With more people owning products like heart-monitoring watches, always-listening speakers, smart TVs or even digital purifying fans, there is much more data being produced. Eventually, as with most digital businesses, this data is going to be exploited and sold to other companies.</p>
        
        <p>Authority plays an important role in social engineering, what is more important is that creating a set of rules that people can follow gives them hope, faith and direction. What is worse is that by masking surveillance and presenting it as anonymity, people are not informed of all the data that they give away about themselves for free. From a technologically determinist view, technological advancements contribute to the shaping of our values and how we choose to reveal our information.</p>
