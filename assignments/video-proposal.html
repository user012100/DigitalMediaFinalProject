        <h4>Video Proposal</h4>
   
        <p>Similarly to the audio project, I want the video project to portray the difficulties of people in South Bronx who cannot afford the subway fare. Compared to the audio project, where I wanted to outline the basis of the project and give an introduction to what one person might experience, in the video project I want to portray other solutions for the MTA that could be implemented instead of increasing fare evasion control and raising prices.</p>
        
        <p>I want the video to be a short  collage and a collection of moving images that represent the problem of surveillance and hightened police activity in the subway stations in South Bronx. Specifically, I want the video to portray the idea of surveillance through the use of the medium itself (video camera, digital movie) and images like security cameras, police, people being recorded with the camera. Since I will be editing the video on Final Cut Pro X, I want to implement several editing techniques as well, like a fast time-lapse of people using the emergency exit in the subway, or color correction to affect the mood that I am trying to achieve. I will be recording the video with a Canon DS700 digital camera and a Rode microphone to capture additional sound as well or a camcorder. I will record the video in the subway on the 6, 5 or 4 lines in the South Bronx, close to Hunts Point.</p>
        
        <p>The audience of the video should feel uncomfortable since I want to convey through imagery like dirty tracks, moldy walls, creepy stairways, that the MTA is not focusing on providing a safe service before trying to fight fare evasion, especially focusing on lower-income areas. In post-production, I will probably add a voiceover to the video to convey the ideas better. I will add text to the video to emphasize important words too.</p>
        
        <p>Lastly, the video project should be able to convey the issue of the MTA wanting to raise the fare, as well as MTA spying on civilians using surveillance cameras, face recognition and law enforcement. I want people to know that communities like Hunts Point in the Bronx are being tracked and surveilled more than other areas, simply because of the disparity between social classes.</p>
