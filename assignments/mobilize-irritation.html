        <h4>Mobilize Irritation</h4>
        
        <p><i>"Irritation is the internalized sense or understanding of irritability, of being mobilized by something."</i></p>
   
        <p>The authors argue that concious beings adapt to everything through a process of a feedback loop. Humans respond to negative and positive stimuli, and either amplify or inhibit the system. By 2007, networking websites like MySpace or Facebook have occupied a substantial amount of internet traffic, generating loads of user-content. These websites were branded as social networks, an easier and simple way for humans to be able to communicate with each other. They were based on communication and building relationships, but profit from user data exploitation and advertising. The irritation that the authors are talking about is negative stimulus from using the Internet.</p>
        
        <p>Nowadays we work, communicate and enterntain ourselves through our computers and smartphones. Boredom has become increasingly more habitual, and people feel the need to relieve themselves of that boredom through short-term dopamine boosts, like checking Instagram, Twitter, Snapchat, texting your friends, watching thousands of YouTube videos, and the list goes on. Since the launch of the App Store for iPhones in 2008, these apps have infiltrated themselves into our lives, and we have become dependent on them psychologically. We receive more stimuli now than ever before, where your phone feels almost like an extension of you body.</p>
        
        <p>Behavior is often changed with computer-based communication and networking, as there is more gratification psychologically for the user to check a message especially when there is an "unread" bubble next to it. This model that was supposed to facilitate communication between people has made its way into our lives, presenting itself as novelty. Companies like Facebook host platforms where users cannot be separated from it, in fear that they will lose communication. For Facebook and other social networks, it is an amazing business model as they profit off people generating their content for free.</p>
        
        <p>Giant tech companies fed this idea to people back when social media was just introduced, and was only accessible on a home computer. However, with all new technological developments in the past 15 years, social media has become engraved into our culture, and there is no escape from it. Now, it is even easier to be addicted to it because of our close relationship with our smartphones, which are now essentially just a digital extension of our mind.</p>
        
        <p>On the contrary, it is impossible to be addicted to the Internet. We, as humans, are only addicted to the content on the Internet. Organizations have accumulated content for our consumption similarly to how we experience it today for quite a while. These companies seeked advertisement revenue through newspapers and magazines, and now it is all digital because of the extreme low-cost distribution and constant optimization. Behavioral economics is essentially a very, <i>very</i> effective marketing strategy.</p>
