        <h4>Audio Scratch Tracks</h4>
   
        <p>To fully immerse a viewer into the experience of the NYC subway system, I wanted to create a sound experience that can portray the difficulties that people who can't afford the fare price. I think I can successfully achieve that through recording of the different atmospheric sounds in the subway. Since there is a lot of sensory overload in the subway station, it can produce a response in the audience. During the sound project, I want to focus on recording daily sounds that most of us notice when we are in the subway, but by isolating them and mixing them into a continious recording would make people approach the fare evasion issue.</p>
