        <h4>Subway Accessibility in the Queens</h4>
   
        <p>An idea that I was leaning towards is the accessibility on the subway. I found a map of the NYC subway with only stations that have elevators for disabled passengers, and most of these are located on Manhattan. However, one particular area with only 3 accessible stations is Queens, specifically the N R W lines. My affected audience for this topic would be disabled passengers who travel from Queens for work.</p>

        <h4>Surveillence in the Bronx</h4>
 
        <p>Another one of my ideas was regarding fare evasion. I noticed yesterday when I was in the Bronx that there was a lot more surveillance in the subway stations. At one station, Hunts Point Ave, there were 3 armed police officers proactively making sure that people don’t jump the turnstile or use the emergency exit. This, on top of increasing fares, affects lower income families in neighborhoods like Hunts Point.</p>
