        <h4>Audio Proposal</h4>
   
        <p>To fully immerse a viewer into the experience of the NYC subway system, I wanted to create a sound experience that can portray the difficulties that people who can't afford the fare price. I think I can successfully achieve that through recording of the different atmospheric sounds in the subway. Since there is a lot of sensory overload in the subway station, it can produce a response in the audience. During the sound project, I want to focus on recording daily sounds that most of us notice when we are in the subway, but by isolating them and mixing them into a continious recording would make people approach the fare evasion issue.</p>
        
        <p>Furthermore, the sounds will include dialogue of people talking in the subway, preferably also expressing their opinions on the system and the MTA. In order to dive into the affected audience of this project, I wanted to also conduct interviews that express people's opinions and their thoughts about fare evasion. I could incorporate these interviews with the background chatter and noises of the subway in the Bronx. I want to specifically ask people about police presense and surveillance, and what feel when they see police officers watching them.</p>
            
        <p>On the other hand, I was thinking about conducting interviews with police officers too, so that they can explain the problem from the side of the law enforcement. In the end, I want the sound project to impact people to look into how the subway assemblage operates, what problems it still faces and why these problems haven't been fully addressed. The goal is to make people think about their everyday subway ride in a different way. A lot of people block off sounds and outside stimuli in the subway with headphones, but focusing on them would be the core of the sound experience.</p>
        
        <p>The soundscape will be an important aspect of the project, it will comprise of trains moving on the dirty, rusty subway tracks; people talking, chatting, arguing and complaining in the background; turnstiles moving as countless people go in and out of the system; and police officers talking on the radio and interacting with people who either tried to sneak through the emergency exit or begging their way into the station. I will be recording these sounds using a Rode microphone on the 2 and 4 lines between 138th St and Simpson St. I will edit the project using Logic Pro X. </p>
        
        <p>Lastly, the audio project should be able to convey the issue of the MTA wanting to raise the fare, as well as MTA spying on civilians using surveillance cameras, face recognition and law enforcement. I want people to know that communities like Hunts Point in the Bronx are being tracked and surveilled more than other areas, simply because of the disparity between social classes.</p>
