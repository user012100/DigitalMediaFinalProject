        <p>The subway system is an assemblage, made of tiny parts that are interconnected. We have become distanced from the inner workings of this mechanism, however, every shift in this assemblage results in a social, political or physical vibratory. As the MTA tries to battle fare evasion, how do these shifts in assemblage affect the people in the South Bronx?</p>
        
        <p>The NYPD made more transit arrests in the first months of 2019 in the Bronx than any district. Fare evasion was a reason for the majority of these arrests, most of which were Black and Latino men.</p>

        <p>The city's decision to crack down on fare evasion has been evident by the increased police presence in South Bronx. The perspective of this population surveillance shifts when looking at it through the recent political movement #BlackLivesMatter, caused by police brutality in the past years. As humans, our threat becomes more increased naturally when there is an association to it. For people who live in the Bronx, coming to work has become more difficult due to the power that the NYPD uniform holds.</p>
        
        <p>“Fare evasion is an essential crime of poverty for our clients and other low-income New Yorkers who are trying to access employment, education, or critical services,” said Anthony Posada, Supervising Attorney of the Community Justice Unit at The Legal Aid Society. “Despite efforts by local district attorneys’ offices to scale back fare beat prosecution, the New York City Police Department continues to target Black and Brown people at a disproportionate rate.”</p>
        
        <p>New York City’s public transportation system loses $240 million a year because of fare evasion, and governor Cuomo's plan was to put 500 police officers on subway and bus routes <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/19/nyregion/newyorktoday/nyc-subway-fare-evasion.html" target="_blank">[4]</a>. He also suggested that "cameras could trigger an alarm whenever a person is seen hopping a turnstile". Unfortunately it is challenging to come up with a solution that satisfies, and doesn't harm a certain community. </p>
