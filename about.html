        <p>South Bronx is a low income area within the New York City borough of the Bronx, consisting of neighborhoods such as Hunts Point, Melrose and Mott Haven. Since the 1980s, South Bronx has seen urban renewal growth, including subsidized housing projects. The area has history of public transportation attached to it, and according to U.S. Bureau of the Census, 77.3% of all households in the South Bronx did not own cars in 2000 <a href="http://www.tstc.org/reports/cpsheets/USCongress_factsheet_district%2016.pdf" target="_blank">[1]</a>. There are over 6 major highways that run through the neighborhood and 6 NYC Subway lines, hence most of the population relies on transportation, including trains and buses. The population of South Bronx is increasing, and NYPD precincts consider it an "impact zone" due to the high crime rate.</p>
        
        <p>The NYPD made more transit arrests in the first months of 2019 in the Bronx than any district. Fare evasion was a reason for the majority of these arrests, most of which were Black and Latino men <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/nypd/downloads/excel/analysis_and_planning/fare-evasion/2019/fare-evasion-arrests-q1-2019.xlsx" target="_blank">[2]</a>.</p>
        
        <p>New York City’s public transportation system loses $240 million a year because of fare evasion, and governor Cuomo's plan was to put 500 police officers on subway and bus routes <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/19/nyregion/newyorktoday/nyc-subway-fare-evasion.html" target="_blank">[3]</a>.</p>
